# fastapi-ocr-tool

This is the FASTAPI implementation with background tasks functionality to produce texts within the images. This portal also uses the concepts of routers and repositories that helps us to build large scale projects.

It can be used to extract texts from the single image file, and when provided multiple images, then it will process each image seperately and generate link button at the homepage for each image name.
